    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h4>Chicken Alfredo is a creamy, indulgent pasta dish that combines tender slices of seasoned, grilled chicken with 
        fettuccine pasta. The pasta is coated in a rich Alfredo sauce made with butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese, 
        offering a velvety texture and savory flavor. Often garnished with fresh parsley and an extra sprinkle of Parmesan, 
        this dish is a comforting and hearty option that pairs well with garlic bread or a crisp side salad.
