    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h4>Spaghetti is a timeless pasta dish often paired with a hearty tomato-based sauce. Long, thin strands of pasta are cooked 
        to a perfect al dente texture, then coated in sauces like marinara, Bolognese, or a simple garlic and olive oil blend. 
        Often topped with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs, spaghetti is a versatile and satisfying meal that can be customized 
        with a variety of vegetables, proteins, or spices to suit any palate.
